## ⚙️ Building systems. Breaking boundaries. Buzzing on caffeine.

Full-stack developer running on **Python**, **PHP**, **Laravel**, **Lua**, **Flutter** — and a dangerously high energy-drink tolerance.

I build during the day, break things at night, and occasionally fix what I broke yesterday.  
If it compiles, it ships. If it crashes, I call it a feature.

🚀 **Red Bull for breakfast, Monster for lunch, Extra Joss for debugging.**  
Curiosity is my fuel, caffeine is my religion.
